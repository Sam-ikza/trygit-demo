     cd cmmnd = change directory (Folder)[wants to move in folder and into inside folder] we use it !
     hidden files = ls -a
     vs code shows symbol M when a file get modified
     so we have to do 2 step process after that
     add it and then commit .
     file types

  1.untracked files = git doesn't know abt this file
  2.modified = changed unmodified = unchanged
  3.staged = files is ready to be commmited (add but doean't commited yet)

The text explains the basic Git commands add and commit.

git add stages new or changed files in the working directory to the Git staging area.

The command git add <file name> is used to stage a specific file.

git commit creates a record of the changes that have been staged.

The command git commit -m "some message" is used to save a snapshot of the staged changes with a descriptive message.

add(engagement stage) --> commit(wedded)!
